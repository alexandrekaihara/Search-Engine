The Chinese government said this week that these were routine space test missions, not a demonstration of a new military weapon. One way or the other, experts said, these tests show China\u2019s notable advances in reusable space technology.\u00a0\nTo be sure, a space vehicle that orbits the Earth, reenters the atmosphere at hypersonic speed and glides to its intended target area is not new technology, said Robert Bakos, principal and co-owner of Innoveering, a company that specializes in propulsion technology used in hypersonic vehicles.\n\u201cThe U.S. had the Space Shuttle and we have the X-37B spaceplane which can be deemed a hypersonic system because when it returns from space, it\u2019s going a very high speeds,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nWhat appears to be a new is the Chinese vehicle\u2019s capability to maneuver after reentry in ways that have not been seen before, Bakos said, adding that he has no direct knowledge of what exactly the Chinese tested and his comments are based on what was publicly reported.\u00a0\nThe X-37 is not a highly maneuverable space vehicle, Bakos noted. NASA\u2019s Space Shuttle glided back from space \u201calmost like a rock basically gliding down very steeply and plopping on the runway.\u201d According to media reports on China\u2019s tests, the vehicle was able to maneuver when it returned from space into the atmosphere \u201cand be more aggressive in terms of its cross range,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would be new in terms of technology.\u201d\u00a0\nIf one is to believe the Chinese government\u2019s explanation that this was just a reusable space vehicle technology demonstration, \u201cin and of itself that would be a very significant demonstration, not trivial by any means,\u201d Bakos said. If China\u2019s vehicle after reentering \u201cmaneuvered in some way that a typical space vehicle does not, that would be alarming.\u201d But he cautioned that whether or not this was a weapon or a nuclear-warhead delivery system being tested is impossible to know without seeing the test data.\n\u201cIf you see a vehicle make a hard left turn at high speed, that\u2019s pretty interesting because it\u2019s hard to do that with a typical space vehicle,\u201d Bakos said. \u201cThey\u2019re not designed aerodynamically to have that capability.\u201d\nImplications for U.S. security\nBakos\u2019 take on the Chinese hypersonic vehicle test echoes what other experts have warned about not rushing to conclusions.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is no Sputnik moment \u2014 partly because it\u2019s not entirely clear what was tested, but mostly because the threat of a Chinese nuclear attack on the United States isn\u2019t remotely new,\u201d wrote James Acton, co-director of the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\nWhile it\u2019s conceivable that China tested a space-based nuclear-weapon delivery system, Acton commented, \u201cI can\u2019t rule out the possibility that China is developing a space plane, like the United States\u2019 X-37B. Because tests of space planes and some orbital weapons could be indistinguishable, determining China\u2019s intentions is difficult. In fact, it is even possible that China tested a technology demonstrator with multiple potential applications.\u201d\nWhat all this means for the hypersonic arms race between the United States, Russia and China remains to be seen, Bakos said. The Pentagon has warned for years that China has developed hypersonic glide vehicles to arm its short-range ballistic missiles. A more advanced vehicle would be concerning, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the element of surprise that becomes destabilizing, unfortunately.\u201d\u00a0\nA long-term concern for the United States is ensuring it has a viable industrial base to advance hypersonic propulsion and other key technologies it would need to stay ahead of rivals, Bakos added. \u201cOur government is starting to look really hard at this.\u201d\u00a0\nAreas that the U.S. should focus on include test capabilities for both ground tests and flight tests, he said.\u00a0\nAnother issue to watch is the domestic industry for hypersonic propulsion technology. Today only two companies \u2014 Northrop Grumman and Aerojet Rocketdyne \u2014 manufacture engines for hypersonic vehicles. Lockheed Martin is seeking to acquire Aerojet and the transaction is currently under government review.\u00a0\nRaytheon and Northrop Grumman announced last month they completed the first flight test of a scramjet-powered hypersonic air-breathing weapon for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the U.S. Air Force.\u00a0\nIn anticipation of China and Russia deploying hypersonic missiles, the Pentagon is developing a network of space sensors in low Earth orbit to fill blind spots in the current U.S. antimissile defense system. DoD concluded that only sensors in low orbits can spot maneuvering missile threats accurately and early enough so they can be shot down. Compared to ballistic missiles, hypersonic glide vehicles are dimmer and harder to detect by U.S. early warning satellites in geostationary orbit 36,000 kilometers above Earth.\u00a0\n \n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMilitary\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nExperimental Spaceplanehypersonic misslesreusable \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsearch\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming Events\n\n\n\nUpcoming Events\nSee Allarrow\n\n\n\n\n\nOct\n26\n\n\n\nProtecting the Higher Ground: Advancing Space Cybersecurity/Next Steps for Space Policy Directive-5\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNov\n02\n\n\n\nSMi\u2019s 23rd Annual Global MilSatCom Conference & Exhibition\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNov\n10\n\n\n\nCyber and Space Security Conference 2021\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\nSpaceNews\n2021 Spacenews, Inc.
