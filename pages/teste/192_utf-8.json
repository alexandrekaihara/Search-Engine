As such, they are helping to be part of the COVID pandemic solution by distributing rapid antigen testing kits at their main building.\nIn partnership with the Government of Saskatchewan, the Regina chamber of commerce was given more than 4,000 rapid test kits on Thursday, Oct. 22, 2021, to distribute to the community. They began handing out the kits on Friday morning with a steady line of people taking advantage of the free kits.\u201cWe\u2019ve been working with the Government of Saskatchewan throughout the pandemic. We always said \u2018if there\u2019s something that we can do, we\u2019d be happy to do so\u2019,\u201d said John Hopkins, CEO of the Regina Chamber & District of Commerce.\u201cWe haven\u2019t really released the fact that we have test kits but we\u2019ve had a steady line up of people all day coming to get the test kits and they are very happy to have them.\u201d  Story continues below advertisement\n\n\n\n  \nRead more: \n\t\t\t\tSaskatchewan government to expand delivery of rapid antigen testing kits\t\t\t\n\nWith the rising numbers of COVID-19 cases in the province, Hopkins says it\u2019s really important for people to get the kits.\u201cWe\u2019re happy to provide that service. At the end of the day, what we\u2019re trying to do is to fight this pandemic that is killing people,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is another step that people can take to see if they are positive.\u201dEach kit contains five rapid tests. According to the Saskatchewan government website, these testing kits do not come individually packaged but are in bundles so kits will be distributed quickly. Availability will be based on the locations\u2019 hours of operation and supply. Self-testing kits will be available first-come, first-served with one kit per household at this time.\u201cRoutine, voluntary testing at home will help prevent asymptomatic transmission to those who are not able to be vaccinated and will reduce COVID-19 transmission in the community,\u201d according to a Saskatchewan government news release. \nRead more: \n\t\t\t\tCOVID-19: Saskatchewan ordering more rapid test kits, may look for other options as demand grows\t\t\t\n\nThe chamber of commerce in Regina has scheduled Tuesdays for pick-up from 8 a.m to 12 p.m.; and Thursdays from 12 p.m. to 4 p.m.  Story continues below advertisement\n\n\n\n The Saskatchewan Chamber of Commerce is also distributing rapid tests, on Mondays from 12 p.m. to 4 p.m. and Wednesdays from 9a.m. to 1 p.m.Chamber of commerce buildings in Moose Jaw, Swift Current, Melville, Lloydminster and Meadow Lake are also distributing the rapid test kits.
