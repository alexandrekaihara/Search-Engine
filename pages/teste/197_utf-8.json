Japan are just a side that are improving out of sight,\"\u00a0Wallabies captain Michael Hooper said.\"We expected Japan to play expansive rugby and they delivered on that. They tested us in a lot of areas and it was a very close game in the end.\"In the first half, the Wallabies had opened the scoring with a try to winger Tom Wright in the seventh minute following a nice step and offload from veteran fly-half Quade Cooper.Cooper's long ball also set up the Wallabies' second try to Jordan Petaia, a 14th-minute replacement for Hodge,\u00a0who was forced off with a worrying shoulder injury.The injury could place Hodge in doubt for the Wallabies' remaining three Tests in Europe against Scotland, England and Wales.Having not played in three weeks since the conclusion of the Rugby Championship, Hooper said Saturday's Test was the ideal build-up\u00a0ahead of the three Tests in the UK.\"We haven't played in a while, so it was a high-paced game,\" he said.\"A lot of ball movement, a lot of tackles to be made and some long phases of play too.\"So it's really good preparation for us.\"ABC/AAPPosted\u00a07h ago7 hours agoSat 23 Oct 2021 at 4:16am, updated\u00a04h ago4 hours agoSat 23 Oct 2021 at 7:56amShareCopy linkFacebookTwitterArticle share optionsShare this onFacebookTwitterLinkedInSend this byEmailMessengerCopy linkWhatsAppMore on:JapanAustraliaRugby UnionSportTop Sports StoriesT20 live: Aussies chasing 119 for victory against Proteas in World Cup openerImpressive Matildas take down Brazil in opening friendlyState Of Rest wins dramatic Cox Plate after dismissed protestMacarthur FC rocked as former Socceroo announces retirementAsh Barty ends her 2021 season early to focus on Australian summer'Ben is our still our brother': Calls for support from Simmons's teammatesTop StoriesRollout of COVID-19 vaccine booster shots likely to follow a familiar timelineForensics officers gathering evidence of possible scoping at Cleo Smith's homeThousands of teachers could be absent from schools on MondayCrew member unknowingly handed Baldwin loaded gun before film set death, police sayCinematographer shot on movie set grew up on Soviet military base and had worked as investigative reporterCOVID twist in search for man still missing in outback QueenslandAsylum seekers detained in Melbourne hotel test positive to COVID-19Impressive Matildas take down Brazil in opening friendlyanalysisThe COVID shock coming for Queensland \u2014 more deaths in one week than the previous 20 monthsSeven strangers helped Tracey to save her property from a developer claiming squatters' rightsT20 live: Aussies chasing 119 for victory against Proteas in World Cup openerJohnson says fresh UK lockdown not on cards as COVID-19 cases riseanalysisStopping MPs casting a vote?
