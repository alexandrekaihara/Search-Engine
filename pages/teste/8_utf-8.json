I'd also like to thank Cricket South Africa for their support and understanding to allow these changes to be possible.\"We would like to apologise again to fans for the disruption and disappointment of September events. We know it was a day that so many had planned long in advance.\"We recognise that accommodating this extra match means a tighter schedule for the white ball series. We will continue to manage our players' welfare and workloads through next year while we also continue to seek the optimum schedule for fans, players and our partners across the game.''Jay Shah, the BCCI secretary, added: \"I am delighted that the England-India Test series will now have its rightful conclusion. The four Test matches were riveting, and we needed a fitting finale.\"The BCCI recognises and respects the traditional form of the game and is also mindful of its role and obligations towards fellow board members. In the last two months, both BCCI and the ECB have been engaged in discussions and our efforts were aimed at finding a suitable window. I thank the ECB for their understanding and patience in finding an amicable solution.\"Revised 2022 datesJuly 1-5 - Rescheduled 5th LV= Insurance Test vs India, EdgbastonJuly 7 - 1st Vitality T201, Ageas Bowl\nJuly 9 - 2nd Vitality T20I, Edgbaston\nJuly 10 - 3rd Vitality T20I, Trent BridgeJuly 12 - 1st Royal London ODI, Kia Oval\nJuly 14 - 2nd Royal London ODI, Lord's\nJuly 17 - 3rd Royal London ODI, Emirates Old TraffordAugust 25-29 - 2nd LV= Insurance Test vs South Africa, Emirates Old TraffordIndiaEnglandICC World Test ChampionshipTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsFeedback", "encoding": "utf-8"}
