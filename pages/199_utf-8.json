They\u2019re under enormous pressure from the public, but everyone I\u2019m talking to is working harder than ever.\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing a phenomenal job under very difficult circumstances, but the public perception doesn\u2019t always recognise that.\u201d\nMr Bolton also says the way the NHS collects and uses data is \u201cnot logical\u201d, with ongoing work by trusts, integrated care systems and national bodies \u201coverlapping considerably\u201d.\nHis priorities include making the role of the centre, and the way in which it can support trusts and ICSs, made clearer \u2013 as well as putting an end to \u201cduplication\u201d and the NHS creating \u201ctwo solutions to the same problem\u201d.\nHe adds: \u201cWe need to work with ICSs and providers to make sure we\u2019re aligned and designing the right solutions, and then have conversations about who does what.\n\u201cAt the moment we overlap considerably. From speaking to chief information officers at trusts I think some see the centre \u2013 particularly NHSD and NHSX \u2013 as maybe arrogant, maybe quite detached, and the reality is we\u2019re here to serve, support and achieve the same outcomes.\u201d\nProviders often have \u201cno idea\u201d what the data they spend \u201ctime and effort to provide\u201d to the centre is used for, he says. Read Nick Carding\u2019s full interview here.\nOwnership of care\nAn \u201cindustrial scale\u201d expansion of patient initiated follow-ups is among the \u201cgame-changers\u201d national leaders are considering to address the elective backlog.\nSir Jim Mackey, chief executive of Northumbria Healthcare Foundation Trust, said that \u201ctwo or three access methods\u201d are being considered to give the public greater ownership over their care.\nThis would include giving patients the choice over whether a follow-up is necessary. Sir Jim, NHS England\u2019s elective recovery adviser, said many reviews in outpatients are \u201cpointless\u201d.\nHe told at a webinar hosted by The Health Foundation that the NHS risks a \u201cretirement rush\u201d if there are no \u201cgame changers\u201d in how electives are handled, and staff are simply told to work harder.\nLast year NHSE encouraged trusts to adopt a patient initiated follow-up system but the use of this is not widespread. It seems NHSE want to give this another push ahead of winter.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo comments yet\n\n\n\n\n\nYou're not signed in.\n\n\nOnly registered users can comment on this article.\nSign in\nRegister\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Daily InsightNewsDaily Insight: Time is a healer2021-10-22T01:00:00ZThe must-read stories and debate in health policy and leadership.NewsDaily Insight: Centre is at the core of HSJ1002021-10-21T01:01:00ZThe must-read stories and debate in health policy and leadership.NewsDaily Insight: Building impatience2021-10-20T01:02:00ZThe must-read stories and debate in health policy and leadership.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLoad more articles\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertiseAwardsEventsContact UsDownload the appHSJ PartnersMembershipSubscribe\n\nConnect with HSJ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA-Z of subjectsTerms and conditionsPrivacy PolicySubscriptions FAQ\u00a9 2021 Wilmington plc\n\n\n\n HSJ is part of Wilmington Healthcare Limited.
