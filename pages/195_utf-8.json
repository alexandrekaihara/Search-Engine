I\u2019d also like to thank Cricket South Africa for their support and understanding to allow these changes to be possible.\n\u201cWe would like to apologise again to fans for the disruption and disappointment of September events. We know it was a day that so many had planned long in advance.\n\u201cWe recognise that accommodating this extra match means a tighter schedule for the white ball series. We will continue to manage our players\u2019 welfare and workloads through next year while we also continue to seek the optimum schedule for fans, players and our partners across the game.\"\n\u201cI am delighted that the England-India Test series will now have its rightful conclusion. The four Test matches were riveting, and we needed a fitting finale,\" said Jay Shah, the Honorary Secretary of BCCI.\n\"The BCCI recognizes and respects the traditional form of the game and is also mindful of its role and obligations towards fellow Board Members. In the last two months, both BCCI and the ECB have been engaged in discussions and our efforts were aimed at finding a suitable window. I thank the ECB for their understanding and patience in finding an amicable solution.\u201d\nRevised schedule:\nRescheduled fifth Test, Edgbaston - 1-5 July\n1st T20I, Ageas Bowl - 7 July\n2nd T20I, Edgbaston - 9 July\n3rd T20I, Trent Bridge - 10 July\n1st ODI, The Oval - 12 July\n2nd ODI, Lord\u2019s - 14 July\n3rd ODI, Old Trafford - 17 July\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy Link\nURL Copied\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAUS v SA, Live Report\n\nAustralia bowlers restrict South Africa to 118/9\n\n    23 Oct 21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatch preview\n\nA 2016 final rematch between T20 heavyweights\n\n    23 Oct 21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT20 World Cup\n\nAustralia to go all-rounder heavy, Proteas get Shamsi boost\n\n    23 Oct 21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatch preview\n\nAustralia and Proteas chase perfect start in daunting Super 12 group\n\n    23 Oct 21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                    T20 World Cup\n                \n\n\n\n                            03:00\n\n                \n\nInnings Highlights: Australia v South Africa\n\n    23 Oct 21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                    T20 World Cup\n                \n\n\n\n                            00:31\n\n                \n\nMarkram's fighting knock of 40 comes to an end\n\n    23 Oct 21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                    T20 World Cup\n                \n\n\n\n                            00:30\n\n                \n\nMarkram drills one onto the hill\n\n    23 Oct 21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                    T20 World Cup\n                \n\n\n\n                            00:34\n\n                \n\nA terrible mix-up leads to the run out of Maharaj\n\n    23 Oct 21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Personalise your homepage with an ICC account\n                    \n\n                            News, fixtures and updates tailored to your favourite team.
