For city clusters, see  Megalopolis . \n   Singapore , a sovereign city-state that is entirely urban \n   Greater Tokyo Area , Japan, the world's most populated urban area, with about 38 million inhabitants \n An  urban area , or  built-up area , is a  human settlement  with a high  population density  and  infrastructure  of  built environment . Urban areas are created through  urbanization  and are categorized by  urban morphology  as  cities ,  towns ,  conurbations  or  suburbs . In  urbanism , the term contrasts to  rural areas  such as  villages  and  hamlets ; in  urban sociology  or  urban anthropology  it contrasts with  natural environment . The creation of early predecessors of urban areas during the  urban revolution  led to the creation of human  civilization  with modern  urban planning , which along with other human activities such as  exploitation of natural resources  led to a  human impact on the environment . \"Agglomeration effects\" are in the list of the main consequences of increased rates of firm creation since. This is due to conditions created by a greater level of industrial activity in a given region. However, a favorable environment for human capital development would also be generated simultaneously. [1] \n The world's urban population in 1950 of just 746 million has increased to 3.9 billion in the decades since. [2]  In 2009, the number of people living in urban areas (3.42 billion) surpassed the number living in rural areas (3.41 billion), and since then the world has become more urban than rural. [3]  This was the first time that the majority of the world's population lived in a city. [4]  In 2014 there were 7.3 billion people living on the planet, [5]  of which the global urban population comprised 3.9 billion. The Population Division of the  United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs  at that time predicted the urban population would grow to 6.4 billion by 2050, with 37% of that growth to come from three countries:  China ,  India  and  Nigeria . [2] \n \n The UN publishes data on cities, urban areas and rural areas, but relies almost entirely on national definitions of these areas. The UN principles and recommendations state that due to different characteristics of urban and rural areas across the globe, a global definition is not possible. [6] \n Urban areas are created and further developed by the process of urbanization. Urban areas are measured for various purposes, including analyzing  population density  and  urban sprawl .\n Unlike an urban area, a  metropolitan area  includes not only the urban area, but also  satellite  cities plus intervening rural land that is socio-economically connected to the  urban core  city, typically by  employment  ties through  commuting , with the urban core city being the primary labor market.\n The concept of an \"urban area\" as used in economic statistics should not be confused with the concept of the \"urban area\" used in road safety statistics. The last concept is also known as \" built-up area in road safety \". According to the definition by the  Office for National Statistics , \"Built-up areas are defined as land which is 'irreversibly urban in character', meaning that they are characteristic of a town or city. They include areas of built-up land with a minimum of 20 hectares (200,000\u00a0m 2 ; 49 acres). Any areas [separated by] less than 200 metres [of non-urban space] are linked to become a single built-up area.

In less-developed countries [ which? ] , in addition to land use and density requirements, a requirement that a large majority of the population, typically 75%, is not engaged in agriculture and/or fishing is sometimes used. [ citation needed ] \n \n Asia [ edit ] \n East Asia [ edit ] \n China [ edit ] \n Main article:  List of cities in China by population and built-up area \n Since 2000,  China 's cities have expanded at an average rate of 10% annually. It is estimated that China's urban population will increase by 292 million people by 2050, [2]  when its cities will house a combined population of over one billion. [9]  The country's urbanization rate increased from 17.4% to 46.6% between 1978 and 2009. [10]  Between 150 and 200\u00a0million  migrant workers  work part-time in the major cities, returning home to the countryside periodically with their earnings. [11] [12] \n Today, China has more cities with one million or more long-term residents than any other country, including the three  global cities  of  Beijing , Hong Kong, and  Shanghai ; by 2025, the country will be home to 221 cities with over a million inhabitants. [9]  The figures in the table below are from the 2008 census, and are only estimates of the urban populations within administrative city limits; a different ranking exists when considering the total municipal populations (which includes suburban and rural populations). The large \" floating populations \" of migrant workers make conducting censuses in urban areas difficult; [13]  the figures below include only long-term residents.\n \n   Panoramic view of  Pudong's  Skyline from  the Bund  in  Shanghai . \n Japan [ edit ] \n In  Japan  urbanized areas are defined as  contiguous  areas of densely inhabited districts (DIDs) using  census  enumeration districts as units with a density requirement of 4,000 inhabitants per square kilometre (10,000/sq\u00a0mi).\n \n South Asia [ edit ] \n India [ edit ] \n Main articles:  Urbanisation in India  and  List of cities in India by population \n For the Census of India 2011, the definition of urban area is a place having a minimum population of 5,000 of density 400 persons per square kilometre (1,000/sq\u00a0mi) or higher, and 75% plus of the male working population employed in non-agricultural activities. Places administered by a municipal corporation, cantonment board or notified town area committee are automatically considered urban areas. [14] \n The Census of India 2011 also defined the term \"urban agglomeration\" as an integrated urban area consisting of a core town together with its \"outgrowths\" (contiguous suburbs).

The majority of southern Pakistan's population lives along the Indus River. Karachi is its most populous city. [18]  In the northern half of the country, most of the population lives in an arc formed by the cities of  Lahore ,  Faisalabad ,  Rawalpindi ,  Islamabad ,  Gujranwala ,  Sialkot ,  Gujrat ,  Jhelum ,  Sargodha ,  Sheikhupura ,  Nowshera ,  Mardan  and  Peshawar . During 1990\u00e2\u0080\u00932008, city dwellers made up 36% of Pakistan's population, making it the most urbanised nation in South Asia. Furthermore, 50% of Pakistanis live in towns of 5,000 people or more. [19] \nKarachi is the most populated city in Pakistan closely followed by Lahore according to the  2017 Census .\n \n Bangladesh [ edit ] \n In  Bangladesh , there are total 532 urban areas, which are divided into three categories. Those are  City Corporation ,  Municipal Corporation  (Pourasova) and  Upazila town . Among those urban areas,  Dhaka  is the largest city by population and area, with a population of 19.10 million. [20]  In  Bangladesh , there are total 11  City Corporations  and 329  Municipal Corporations  and 203  Small towns , which serves as the center for  Upazilas . According to 2011 population census,  Bangladesh  has an urban population of 28%, with a growth rate of 2.8%. [21]  At this growth rate, it is estimated that the urban population of Bangladesh will reach 79 million or 42% of total population by 2035.\n \n Southeast Asia [ edit ] \n \n \n \n \u00a0 v t e   Largest  cities  in Southeast Asia Demographia 2020 \n \n \n \n Rank \n \n Name \n \n Country \n \n  Pop. \n \n Rank \n \n Name \n \n Country \n \n  Pop. \n \n \n \n Jakarta Manila \n \n 1 \n Jakarta \n Indonesia \n 34,540,000 \n 11 \n Medan \n Indonesia \n 3,632,000\n \n Bangkok Ho Chi Minh City \n \n \n 2 \n Manila \n Philippines \n 23,088,000 \n 12 \n Cebu City \n Philippines \n 2,275,000\n \n \n 3 \n Bangkok \n Thailand \n 17,066,000 \n 13 \n Phnom Penh \n Cambodia \n 2,177,000\n \n \n 4 \n Ho Chi Minh City \n Vietnam \n 13,312,000 \n 14 \n Semarang \n Indonesia \n 1,992,000\n \n \n 5 \n Kuala Lumpur \n Malaysia \n 8,285,000 \n 15 \n Johor Bahru \n Malaysia \n 1,981,000\n \n \n 6 \n Bandung \n Indonesia \n 7,065,000 \n 16 \n Makassar \n Indonesia \n 1,952,000\n \n \n 7 \n Hanoi \n Vietnam \n 6,576,000 \n 17 \n Palembang \n Indonesia \n 1,889,000\n \n \n 8 \n Surabaya \n Indonesia \n 6,499,000 \n 18 \n Mandalay \n Myanmar \n 1,633,000\n \n \n 9 \n Yangon \n Myanmar \n 6,314,000 \n 19 \n Hai Phong \n Vietnam \n 1,623,000\n \n \n 10 \n Singapore \n Singapore \n 5,745,000 \n 20 \n Yogyakarta \n Indonesia \n 1,568,000\n \n \n Philippines [ edit ] \n With an estimated population of 16.3 million,  Metro Manila  is the most populous metropolitan area in the  Philippines  and the  11th in the world .

With 64  islands and islets ,  Singapore Island  makes up the largest urban area in the country. According to the  United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , the country has the highest urbanised population in Southeast Asia, with 100 percent of its population living in an urban area. [23]  The  Urban Redevelopment Authority  (URA) is responsible for the urban land-use planning, which designates land use and  urban density  of the country. [24]  The country is divided into 5  regions  for planning purposes by the URA, even though as a city state Singapore is defined as a single continuous urban area. It is further subdivided into 55  urban planning areas , which acts as the boundaries of  planned towns  within the country.

The Randstad has a population of 7\u00a0million inhabitants and is the  6th largest   metropolitan area  in Europe.\n \n Sweden [ edit ] \n Main article:  List of urban areas in Sweden by population \n Urban areas in Sweden  ( t\u00c3\u00a4torter ) are statistically defined localities, totally independent of the administrative subdivision of the country. There are 1,956 such localities in  Sweden , with a population ranging from 200 to 1,372,000 inhabitants. [33] \n \n United Kingdom [ edit ] \n Main article:  List of urban areas in the United Kingdom \n In 2013 the  United Kingdom 's  Office for National Statistics  (ONS) published  2011 Built-up Areas - Methodology and Guidance  which sets out its definition of a built-up area as an area of built-up land of at least 20 hectares (0.077\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), separated from other settlements by at least 200 metres (660\u00a0ft). For 2011 census data there are 5,493 built-up areas, of which 501 are divided into sub-divisions for which data is also available. Each built-up area is named algorithmically, using Ordnance Survey place-name data. [34] \n The ONS has produced census results from urban areas since 1951, since 1981 based upon the extent of irreversible urban development indicated on  Ordnance Survey  maps. The definition is an extent of at least 20 ha and at least 1,500 census residents. Separate areas are linked if less than 200 m (220 yd) apart. Included are transportation features. [35]  The UK has five Urban Areas with a population over a million and a further sixty nine with a  population over one hundred thousand .\n \n \n \n v t e   Largest urban areas of the United Kingdom (England and Wales: 2011 census built-up area; [36]  Scotland: 2016 estimates settlement; [37]  Northern Ireland: 2001 census urban area) [38] \n \n \n \n \n Rank \n \n Urban area \n \n  Pop. \n \n Principal settlement \n \n Rank \n \n Urban area \n \n  Pop. \n \n Principal settlement \n \n \n \n \n Greater London Urban Area \n Greater Manchester Urban Area \n \n \n 1 \n Greater London Urban Area \n 9,787,426 \n London \n 11 \n Bristol Urban Area \n 617,280 \n Bristol \n \n West Midlands Urban Area \n West Yorkshire Urban Area \n \n \n \n 2 \n Greater Manchester Urban Area \n 2,553,379 \n Manchester \n 12 \n Edinburgh Urban Area \n 512,150 \n Edinburgh \n \n \n 3 \n West Midlands Urban Area \n 2,440,986 \n Birmingham \n 13 \n Leicester Urban Area \n 508,916 \n Leicester \n \n \n 4 \n West Yorkshire Urban Area \n 1,777,934 \n Leeds \n 14 \n Belfast Urban Area \n 483,418 \n Belfast \n \n \n 5 \n Greater Glasgow \n 985,290 \n Glasgow \n 15 \n Brighton and Hove built-up area \n 474,485 \n Brighton \n \n \n 6 \n Liverpool Urban Area \n 864,122 \n Liverpool \n 16 \n South East Dorset conurbation \n 466,266 \n Bournemouth \n \n \n 7 \n South Hampshire \n 855,569 \n Southampton \n 17 \n Cardiff Urban Area \n 390,214 \n Cardiff \n \n \n 8 \n Tyneside \n 774,891 \n Newcastle \n 18 \n Teesside \n 376,633 \n Middlesbrough \n \n \n 9 \n Nottingham Urban Area \n 729,977 \n Nottingham \n 19 \n The Potteries Urban Area \n 372,775 \n Stoke-on-Trent \n \n \n 10 \n Sheffield Urban Area \n 685,368 \n Sheffield \n 20 \n Coventry and Bedworth Urban Area \n 359,262 \n Coventry \n \n \n Norway [ edit ] \n Main article:  List of urban areas in Norway by population \n Statistics Norway  defines urban areas (\"tettsteder\")  similarly to the other Nordic countries . Unlike in Denmark and Sweden, the distance between each building has to be of less than 50 m, although exceptions are made due to parks, industrial areas, rivers, and similar. Groups of houses less than 400 m from the main body of an urban area are included in the urban area. [39] \n \n Eastern Europe [ edit ] \n Poland [ edit ] \n In  Poland , official \"urban\" population figures simply refer to those localities which have the status of towns ( miasta ). The \"rural\" population is that of all areas outside the boundaries of these towns. This distinction may give a misleading impression in some cases, since some localities with only village status may have acquired larger and denser populations than many many smaller towns [40]  with most excessive example of  Pozna\u00c5\u0084 , most spread urban area of the country with population of the city app. 534 thousand and urban area above 1,100 thousand inhabitants. On the other hand, the  Upper Silesian Industrial Region  conurbation with numerous large and medium cities covers 3,200\u00a0km and has approximately 3 million people.\n \n Russia [ edit ] \n Moscow , the capital and  largest city  of  Russia , has a population estimated at 12.4 million residents within the city limits, [41]  while over 17 million residents in the urban area, [42]  and over 20 million residents in the  Moscow Metropolitan Area . [43]  It is among the  world's largest cities , being the  most populous city  entirely within  Europe , the  most populous urban area  in Europe, [42]  the  most populous metropolitan area  in Europe, [43]  and also the largest city by land area on the European continent. [44]   Saint Petersburg , the cultural capital, is the second-largest city, with a population of roughly 5.4 million inhabitants. [45]  Other major urban areas are  Yekaterinburg ,  Novosibirsk ,  Kazan ,  Nizhny Novgorod , and  Chelyabinsk .\n \n \n \n \n \n Moscow , the capital and largest city of  Russia \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Saint Petersburg , the cultural capital and the second-largest city\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Yekaterinburg , the fourth-largest city in the country.\n \n \n \n \n Oceania [ edit ] \n Australia [ edit ] \n The  Australian Bureau of Statistics  refers to urban areas as Urban Centres, which it generally defines as population clusters of 1,000 or more people. [46]  Australia is one of the most urbanised countries in the world, with more than 50% of the population residing in Australia's three biggest urban centres. [ citation needed ] \n \n   Sydney  is Australia's largest city, home to 5.3 million inhabitants. [47] \n New Zealand [ edit ] \n Main article:  Urban areas of New Zealand \n Statistics New Zealand  defines urban areas in New Zealand, which are independent of any administrative subdivisions and have no legal basis. [48]  There are three classes of urban area: main urban areas are the 17 urban areas which have a population of 30,000 or more; secondary urban areas are the 14 urban areas which have a population of 10,000 or more but less than 30,000, and minor urban areas are the 103 urban areas which have a population of 1,000 or more but less than 10,000. Urban areas are reclassified after each  New Zealand census , so population changes between censuses does not change an urban area's classification.\n \n North America [ edit ] \n Canada [ edit ] \n Main article:  List of the largest population centres in Canada \n According to  Statistics Canada , an urban area in  Canada  is an area with a population of at least 1,000 people where the density is no fewer than 400 persons per square kilometre (1,000/sq\u00a0mi). [49]  If two or more urban areas are within 2\u00a0km (1.2\u00a0mi) of each other by road, they are merged into a single urban area, provided they do not cross  census metropolitan area  or  census agglomeration  boundaries. [50] \n In the  Canada 2011 Census , Statistics Canada redesignated urban areas with the new term \" population centre \"; [51]  the new term was chosen in order to better reflect the fact that urban vs. rural is not a strict division, but rather a continuum within which several distinct settlement patterns may exist. For example, a community may fit a strictly statistical definition of an urban area, but may not be commonly thought of as \"urban\" because it has a smaller population, or functions socially and economically as a suburb of another urban area rather than as a self-contained urban entity, or is geographically remote from other urban communities. Accordingly, the new definition set out three distinct types of population centres: small (population 1,000 to 29,999), medium (population 30,000 to 99,999) and large (population 100,000 or greater). [51]  Despite the change in terminology, however, the demographic definition of a population centre remains unchanged from that of an urban area: a population of at least 1,000 people where the density is no fewer than 400 persons per km 2 .\n \n United States [ edit ] \n Main article:  List of United States urban areas \n In the United States, there are two categories of urban area. The term  urbanized area  denotes an urban area of 50,000 or more people. Urban areas under 50,000 people are called  urban clusters . Urbanized areas were first delineated in the United States in the 1950 census, while urban clusters were added in the 2000 census. There are 1,371  urban areas and urban clusters  with more than 10,000 people.\n The  U.S. Census Bureau  defines an urban area as \"core census block groups or  blocks  that have a population density of at least 1,000 people per square mile (386 per square kilometer) and surrounding census blocks that have an overall density of at least 500 people per square mile (193 per square kilometer)\". [52] \n The largest urban area in the United States is the  New York metropolitan area . The population of  New York City , the core of the metropolitan area, exceeds 8.5 million people, its  metropolitan statistical area  has a population that is over 20 million, and its  combined statistical area  population is over 23 million. The next seven largest urban areas in the U.S. are  Los Angeles ,  Chicago ,  Miami ,  Philadelphia ,  San Francisco ,  Houston , and  Atlanta . [53]  About 82 percent of the population of the United States lives within the boundaries of an urbanized area as of December, 2010. [54]  Combined, these areas occupy about 2 percent of the land area of the United States. Many Americans live in  agglomerations  of  cities ,  suburbs , and  towns  that are adjacent to a metropolitan area's largest city.

For example, the city of  Greenville, South Carolina  has a city population just over 68,000 and an urbanized area population of around 400,000, while  Greensboro, North Carolina  has a city population just over 285,000 and an urbanized area population of around 300,000\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 meaning that Greenville is actually \"larger\" for some intents and purposes, but not for others, such as taxation, local elections, etc.\n In the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 's  natural resources inventory , urban areas are officially known as  developed areas  or urban and built-up areas. Such areas include cities, ethnic villages, other built-up areas of more than 10 ac (4 ha), industrial sites, railroad yards, cemeteries, airports, golf courses, shooting ranges, institutional and public administration sites, and similar areas. The 1997 national resources inventory placed over 98,000,000 ac (40,000,000 ha) in this category, an increase of 25,000,000 ac (10,000,000 ha) since 1982. [55] \n \n South America [ edit ] \n Argentina [ edit ] \n Argentina is highly urbanized. [56]  The ten largest metropolitan areas account for half of the population, and fewer than one in ten live in rural areas. About 3 million people live in Buenos Aires City and the  Greater Buenos Aires  metropolitan area totals around 15 million, making it one of the largest urban areas in the world, with a population of 18 million all up. [57] \n C\u00c3\u00b3rdoba  has around 1.5 million people living in the urban area, while  Rosario ,  Mendoza  and  Tucum\u00c3\u00a1n  have around 1.2 million inhabitants each [57]  and  La Plata ,  Mar del Plata ,  Salta  and  Santa Fe [57] [58]  have at least 500,000 people each.\n \n Brazil [ edit ] \n Main article:  List of largest cities in Brazil \n According to IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) urban areas already concentrate 84.35% of the population, while the Southeast region remains the most populated one, with over 80 million inhabitants. [59] \nThe largest metropolitan areas in Brazil are S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 all in the Southeastern Region\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 with 21, 12, and 5\u00a0million inhabitants respectively. [60]  In general, state capitals are the largest cities in their states, except for  Vit\u00c3\u00b3ria , the capital of  Esp\u00c3\u00adrito Santo , and  Florian\u00c3\u00b3polis , the capital of Santa Catarina. There are also non-capital metropolitan areas in the states of S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo ( Campinas ,  Santos  and the  Para\u00c3\u00adba Valley ),  Minas Gerais  ( Steel Valley ), Rio Grande do Sul ( Sinos Valley ) and Santa Catarina ( Itaja\u00c3\u00ad Valley ).
