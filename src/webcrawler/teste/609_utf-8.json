She is also sometimes considered the daughter of  Jupiter  (called  Zeus  by the Greeks), [1]  or a creation of  Prometheus . [2] [3]  The elusive goddess is said to have hidden in the bottom of a  holy well . [4]  She is depicted both as a virgin dressed in white and as the \"naked truth\" ( nuda veritas ) holding a hand mirror. [5] [6] [7] \n Veritas is also the name given to the  Roman virtue  of  truthfulness , which was considered one of the main virtues any good Roman should possess. The Greek goddess of truth is  Aletheia  ( Ancient Greek :  \u00e1\u00bc\u0088\u00ce\u00bb\u00ce\u00ae\u00ce\u00b8\u00ce\u00b5\u00ce\u00b9\u00ce\u00b1 ). The German philosopher  Martin Heidegger  argues that the truth represented by  aletheia  (which essentially means \"unconcealment\") is different from that represented by  veritas , which is linked to a Roman understanding of rightness and finally to a Nietzschean sense of justice and a will to power. [8] \n In  Western culture , the word may also serve as a  motto . \n \n Contents \n \n 1   Mottos \n 2   See also \n 3   Notes \n 4   External links \n \n \n Mottos [ edit ] \n This  Latin  word \" veritas \" now appears in the  mottos  of many  colleges ,  universities  and other diverse organizations. It is typically capitalized in mottoes (as \" Veritas \") for being an ideal (such as: Truth, Kindness and Beauty).   Veritas  is the motto of  Harvard University ,  Hutchesons' Grammar School ,  The University of Western Ontario ,  Drake University ,  Knox College (Illinois) ,  Bilkent University , the University of California - Hastings College of the Law, as well as the  Dominican Order  of the  Roman Catholic Church , and  Providence College  and  Molloy College  which is run by the Dominicans. \"Veritas\" is also the motto of Loyola College, Ibadan in Nigeria. Loyola College was established by the Roman Catholic Church and named for St. Ignatius of Loyola. Additionally, the word appears in mottoes that are phrases, or lists e.g. the  Buckley School  of the  City of New York  employs the phrase  Honor et Veritas , the  University of Indonesia 's motto is \"Veritas, Probitas, Iustitia\", the  University of Cape Coast  in  Ghana 's motto is \"Veritas Nobis Lumen\", the  University of Michigan 's motto is: \"Artes, Scientia, Veritas\".

It also appears on the  California State University 's motto  Vox Veritas Vita  (\"Speak the Truth as a way of Life\").   Veritas Curat  (\"Truth Cures\") is the motto of the  Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research , a medical school in  Puducherry ,  India .  Howard University , in  Washington, D.C. , goes by the motto \"Veritas et Utilitas\", translated to \"Truth and Service\", which is also a motto \"Truth-Service\" of  Payap University ,  Thailand . It also exists in the logo of  Seoul National University , Korea: \"Veritas Lux Mea\" \u2013 meaning \"Truth is my light\".  Villanova University  also uses Veritas in its school motto,  Veritas, Unitas, Caritas  (\"Truth, Unity, Love\").  Uppsala University  in Sweden also uses Veritas in its school motto, \"Gratiae veritas naturae\".\n The  Naval Criminal Investigative Service , the U.S. Navy's primary counterintelligence arm and law enforcement agency, uses the motto on its official seal. \n The American communications company  Verizon  has its name derive from the combination of the words  veritas  and  horizon  - chosen from 8,500 candidates with $300\u00a0million spent on marketing the new brand.

Approaching from far away, the future has arrived and made me ashamed of my deep debt. Still, payment with interest has a way of dissolving the bitter reproach of men. [1] \n \n ^   Aesop   Fables  530 (from  Phaedrus  Appendix 5):  Prometheus , that potter who gave shape to our new generation, decided one day to sculpt a statue of Truth, using all his skill so that she would be able to regulate people's behaviour. As he was working, an unexpected summons from mighty Jupiter called him away. Prometheus left cunning Trickery in charge of his workshop (Trickery had recently become one of the god's apprentices). Fired by ambition, Trickery used the time at his disposal to fashion with his sly fingers a figure of the same size and appearance as Truth with identical features. When he had almost completed the piece, which was truly remarkable, he ran out of clay to use for her feet. The master returned, so Trickery quickly sat down in his seat, quaking with fear. Prometheus was amazed at the similarity of the two statues and wanted it to seem as if all the credit were due to his own skill. Therefore, he put both statues in the kiln and when they had been thoroughly baked, he infused them both with life: sacred Truth walked with measured steps, while her unfinished twin stood stuck in her tracks. That forgery, that product of subterfuge, thus acquired the name of Falsehood, and I readily agree with people who say that she has no feet: every once in a while something that is false can start off successfully, but with time the Truth is sure to prevail.
